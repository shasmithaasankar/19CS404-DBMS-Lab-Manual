| Payment       |  PaymentID (PK), Account, Amount, Date                  |  Records payments for memberships or sessions     |

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|

|  Trainer – Program       |   M:N          |  Mandatory for both             | Trainer may or may not run Programs      |
|  Member – Payment            |   1:N        |  Mandatory for Payment             |Payments belong to members |

### Assumptions
- Every member must enroll in at least one program.
